    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>Who made this website?</h3>
    <p>Hey! I'm Aniruddha Murali, and I'm a freshman at Georgia Tech studying computer science.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Why did I make this website?</h3>
    <p>
        After seeing how widespread and devastating the impact from COVID-19 has been, I wanted to see if there
        was anything I could do to help people out. Recently, I've been learning a lot about data visualization and web
        development, and I wanted to see if I could make something that people would find useful in these difficult times.
        My goal with this website was to provide real-time information on COVID-19 so people can stay up-to-date. I hope
        you're finding it useful!
